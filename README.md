## Features
- **Automatic Table Creation**: Automatically creates the necessary `tickets` table if it doesnâ€™t already exist.
- **Ticket Operations**: Create, update, and delete tickets with ease.
- **Status Management**: Update ticket statuses to track ongoing and closed tickets.
- **User Validation**: Ensure only valid users can interact with tickets.

## Requirements

- PDO extension enabled
- MySQL database
